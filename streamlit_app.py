    ## Overview
    * The "Audio to Text Transcription with [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)" project is a web application that allows users to upload audio files and convert them into text using the AssemblyAI API. This project demonstrates the integration of AssemblyAI's powerful speech-to-text capabilities with the interactive features of Streamlit, a popular framework for creating data applications in Python.

    ## Objectives
    * **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide a simple and intuitive web interface for users to upload audio files and receive transcriptions.
    * **Real-Time Transcription**: Utilize AssemblyAI's API to convert audio to text in real-time.
    * **Interactive Features**: Allow users to play the uploaded audio file within the application and view the transcription results.

    ## Key Features
    * **Audio File Upload**: Users can upload audio files in various formats including WAV, MP3, and M4A.
    * **API Integration**: Seamless integration with AssemblyAI API for uploading audio files and fetching transcription results.
    * **Real-Time Feedback**: Display a progress spinner while the transcription is being processed and show the transcription result once completed.
    * **Audio Playback**: Allow users to play the uploaded audio file directly in the application.
    * **Error Handling**: Provide appropriate feedback in case of transcription failures.
